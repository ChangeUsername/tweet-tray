## Introduction

Tweet Tray is a small Electron and React application which allows you to tweet from your desktop system tray or status bar, without any further distractions.

## Installation

1. Clone the Tweet Tray repository from Github to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray.git
```

2. To run Tweet Tray locally you will need to first install either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package managers.

3. Setup the applications' dependencies by navigating to the `tweettray` directory and run either `npm install` or `yarn install`.

4. After everything has been installed simply call `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

## Development

For all new features or bug fixes please create pull requests directly into the `development` branch. Once your pull request has been successfully rebased and merged a separate request can then be made to merge into `master`.
