## Introduction

Tweet Tray is a small application which allows you to tweet from your desktop system tray or status bar, without any further distractions. The core technology used consists of Electron, React + Redux and Styled Components. All transpiled from ES6 Javascript.

## Installation

1. Clone the Tweet Tray repository from Github to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/jonathontoon/tweet-tray.git
```

2. To run Tweet Tray locally you will need to first install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package managers.

3. Setup the applications' dependencies by navigating to the `tweet-tray` directory and run `yarn install`.

4. After everything has been installed simply call `yarn dev` to run the development build. To run the production build you can call `yarn prestart` followed by `yarn start`.

## Development

For all new features or bug fixes simply submit a pull request directly into the `develop` branch. Once your pull request has been successfully rebased and tested a separate request can then be made to merge into `master`.

## Deployment

To create an installable build simply call `yarn package`, which will create an executable based on your current operating system. If you want to debug something in a packaged build you can call `DEBUG_PROD=true yarn package`.

## Acknowledgements

This project is based off [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate), all methodloligies still apply, except for the removal of Flow and SASS.
